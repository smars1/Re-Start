Exercise 1: Use Antivirus Software to Detect a Threat
In this exercise, you will execute a test virus file to assess the currently used antivirus solution that is protecting the windows10 system.

Note

EICAR, or European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research, was originally founded to advance antivirus research. It has recently broadened its field of expertise to include malware as a whole and general IT security topics, but it is still an excellent resource for testing the effectiveness of an antivirus solution. Multiple types of files that generate virus alerts to assess solutions are available at http://2016.eicar.org/85-0-Download.html.

1. Log in to the windows10 system using userid of cybersec and password of cybersec.

2. In File Explorer, browse to the c:\unsecure folder.

3. Right-click the eicar zipped file, and select Extract All.

# Exercise 2: Perform an On-Demand Scan
It is critical that you not rely solely on the memory resident functionality of antivirus. An on-demand scan can be used to detect malware on the disk. Often, temporary Internet locations contain malicious files, so you should run a scan on a regular basis.

1. On the desktop, double-click AVG.

2. Click the AntiVirus Free button.
